## 14. Foundational Architecture

### 1. Core Components & Rationale

MentorMatch Global utilizes a modular architecture built upon Laravel for the backend and React/Inertia.js with TypeScript for the frontend. This separation of concerns enables independent scaling and development. Key components include:

*   **Backend (Laravel):** Manages the API, business logic, database interactions, authentication, authorization, and real-time events.
*   **Frontend (React/Inertia.js/TypeScript):** Handles the user interface, user interactions, and data presentation. Inertia.js acts as the glue between Laravel and React, simplifying routing and data fetching.
*   **Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL):** Stores user data, profiles, mentorship sessions, reviews, and other relational data.
*   **Redis:** Used for caching, session management, and real-time event broadcasting (with `laravel-echo-server`).
*   **Object Storage (AWS S3/Google Cloud Storage):** Stores user-uploaded files (e.g., profile pictures, documents).

Rationale:

*   **Scalability:** Laravel's queue system and Redis integration facilitate asynchronous processing and horizontal scaling. React's component-based architecture enables efficient rendering and reuse.
*   **Security:** Laravel's built-in security features, combined with secure coding practices and regular security audits, mitigate OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
*   **Maintainability:** The modular architecture promotes code reusability and simplifies debugging and maintenance. TypeScript enhances code quality and reduces runtime errors.
*   **User Experience:** React provides a fast and responsive user interface, while Inertia.js simplifies routing and data fetching.

By using the 'laravel/react-starter-kit', which is a modern framework, the project leverages the best features of both technologies, TypeScript's type safety, and a streamlined development workflow.

### 2. Database Schema Design

The database schema consists of several key tables:

*   **Users:** Stores user authentication information (id, name, email, password, role (mentor/mentee), email_verified_at, created_at, updated_at).
*   **Profiles:** Stores user profile data (id, user_id (FK), bio, skills (JSON), experience (JSON), goals (JSON), industry_id (FK), career_path_id (FK), avatar_url, timezone, location).
*   **MentorshipSessions:** Stores information about mentorship sessions (id, mentor_id (FK), mentee_id (FK), start_time, end_time, status (scheduled, completed, cancelled), notes).
*   **Reviews:** Stores reviews and ratings for mentors (id, mentor_id (FK), mentee_id (FK), rating, comment, created_at, updated_at).
*   **Industries:** Stores a list of industries (id, name).
*   **CareerPaths:** Stores a list of career paths (id, name).
*   **Notifications:** Stores user-specific notifications (id, user_id (FK), type, data (JSON), read_at (nullable timestamp), created_at, updated_at).
*   **PasswordResets:** Stores password reset tokens (email, token, created_at).
*   **FailedJobs:** Stores failed queue jobs (id, connection, queue, payload, exception, failed_at).
*   **PersonalAccessTokens:** Stores API tokens (id, tokenable_type, tokenable_id, name, token, abilities, last_used_at, expires_at, created_at, updated_at).

JSON columns in Profiles (skills, experience, goals) allow for flexible data storage and can be queried using Laravel's JSON column support. Foreign keys ensure data integrity and relationships between tables. Indexes are used to optimize query performance.

### 3. API Design & Key Endpoints

The API follows a RESTful design using Laravel's resource controllers. API versioning is implemented using a `/api/v1/` prefix.

Key endpoints include:

*   **Authentication:**
    *   `POST /api/v1/register`: Registers a new user.
    *   `POST /api/v1/login`: Logs in an existing user.
    *   `POST /api/v1/logout`: Logs out the current user.
    *   `POST /api/v1/password/reset`: Sends a password reset email.
    *   `POST /api/v1/password/reset/confirm`: Resets the user's password.
    *   `GET /api/v1/user`: Retrieves the authenticated user's data.
*   **Profiles:**
    *   `GET /api/v1/profiles/{id}`: Retrieves a user profile.
    *   `PUT /api/v1/profiles/{id}`: Updates a user profile.
*   **Mentorship Sessions:**
    *   `GET /api/v1/mentorship-sessions`: Retrieves a list of mentorship sessions for the authenticated user (as a mentor or mentee).
    *   `POST /api/v1/mentorship-sessions`: Creates a new mentorship session.
    *   `GET /api/v1/mentorship-sessions/{id}`: Retrieves a specific mentorship session.
    *   `PUT /api/v1/mentorship-sessions/{id}`: Updates a mentorship session.
    *   `DELETE /api/v1/mentorship-sessions/{id}`: Cancels a mentorship session.
*   **Reviews:**
    *   `POST /api/v1/reviews`: Creates a new review for a mentor.
    *   `GET /api/v1/reviews/{mentor_id}`: Retrieves reviews for a specific mentor.
*   **Matching:**
    *   `GET /api/v1/matches`: Retrieves a list of potential mentors/mentees based on the user's profile and preferences.
*   **Notifications:**
    *   `GET /api/v1/notifications`: Retrieves a list of notifications for the authenticated user.
    *   `POST /api/v1/notifications/{id}/mark-as-read`: Marks a notification as read.

API requests are authenticated using Laravel Sanctum, which provides a lightweight token-based authentication system suitable for SPAs.

### 4. Frontend Structure (TypeScript)

The frontend is built using React, Inertia.js, and TypeScript. The directory structure is organized as follows:

*   `resources/ts/`: Root directory for frontend code.
    *   `Components/`: Reusable React components (e.g., buttons, form fields, profile cards).
    *   `Layouts/`: Application layouts (e.g., main layout, guest layout).
    *   `Pages/`: React components representing individual pages (e.g., Home, Profile, Mentorship Sessions).
    *   `Services/`: TypeScript classes or functions for interacting with the API (e.g., AuthService, ProfileService).
    *   `Types/`: TypeScript type definitions for data models (e.g., User, Profile, MentorshipSession).
    *   `Utils/`: Utility functions (e.g., date formatting, string manipulation).
    *   `hooks/`: Custom React hooks to reuse component logic.
    *   `app.tsx`: Entry point for the React application.
    *   `inertia.ts`: Inertia.js configuration.

Each React component is written in TypeScript (.tsx extension) and uses functional components with React Hooks. State management is handled using React's built-in `useState` and `useContext` hooks. Complex state management can be managed using a state management library like Zustand or Jotai, if necessary. Component styling is done using CSS Modules or a CSS-in-JS library like Styled Components.

The 'Pages' directory maps directly to Laravel routes, thanks to Inertia.js. Data is passed from Laravel controllers to React components as props. Form submissions are handled using Inertia.js's `useForm` hook.

### 5. Real-time & Events Architecture

Real-time functionality is implemented using Laravel's event broadcasting system and Redis, along with `laravel-echo-server`. The architecture includes:

*   **Laravel Events:** Define events that occur in the application (e.g., `MentorshipSessionCreated`, `MessageSent`).
*   **Event Listeners:** Listen for specific events and perform actions, such as broadcasting the event to a Redis channel.
*   **Redis:** Acts as the message broker for real-time events.
*   **`laravel-echo-server`:** A Node.js server that listens for events on Redis channels and broadcasts them to connected clients via WebSockets.
*   **Frontend (React):** Uses the `laravel-echo` JavaScript library to subscribe to specific channels and listen for events. Updates the UI in real-time when new events are received.

Example:

When a new message is sent in a mentorship session, a `MessageSent` event is fired. The event listener broadcasts the event to a private channel (`mentorship-sessions.{session_id}`). The React component responsible for displaying the chat messages subscribes to this channel using `laravel-echo` and updates the UI in real-time when a new message is received.

Channels are secured using authentication and authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can subscribe to specific channels. Private channels require authentication, while presence channels allow tracking of users who are currently subscribed to a channel.

### 6. Authentication & Authorization Flow

Authentication is handled using Laravel Sanctum, providing a lightweight token-based authentication system for SPAs.

1.  **Registration:** A user submits their registration information (name, email, password).
2.  **Backend:** The Laravel backend validates the input, creates a new user account, and generates a Sanctum API token.
3.  **Response:** The API token is returned to the frontend.
4.  **Frontend:** The frontend stores the API token in local storage or a cookie.
5.  **Subsequent Requests:** For subsequent API requests, the frontend includes the API token in the `Authorization` header (`Bearer {token}`).
6.  **Backend:** The Laravel backend authenticates the request using the API token and retrieves the associated user.

Authorization is handled using Laravel's built-in authorization features, including policies and gates. Policies define which users are allowed to perform specific actions on specific resources (e.g., update a profile, cancel a mentorship session). Gates provide a simple way to define authorization rules that are not tied to a specific resource.

Middleware is used to protect routes and ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access specific resources.

Role-based access control (RBAC) can be implemented by adding a `role` column to the `users` table and using policies to restrict access based on user roles (e.g., administrator, mentor, mentee).

### 7. Deployment & Scalability Plan

The application will be deployed using a containerized approach with Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes or Docker Compose. This allows for consistent deployments across different environments and simplifies scaling.

1.  **Dockerization:** The Laravel backend and `laravel-echo-server` are packaged as Docker containers.
2.  **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes or Docker Compose is used to manage the deployment and scaling of the containers.
3.  **Database:** A managed database service (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL) is used for the database. This provides automatic backups, scaling, and high availability.
4.  **Redis:** A managed Redis service (e.g., AWS ElastiCache, Google Cloud MemoryStore, Azure Cache for Redis) is used for caching, session management, and real-time event broadcasting.
5.  **Object Storage:** AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage is used for storing user-uploaded files.
6.  **Load Balancing:** A load balancer (e.g., AWS ALB, Google Cloud Load Balancing) is used to distribute traffic across multiple backend instances.
7.  **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) is used to automate the build, test, and deployment process. This ensures that code is automatically tested and deployed to production whenever changes are committed to the repository.

Scaling is achieved by horizontally scaling the backend instances and the `laravel-echo-server` instances. The database and Redis instances can also be scaled as needed. Load testing should be conducted regularly to identify bottlenecks and ensure that the application can handle the expected traffic.

### 8. Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy is implemented to ensure the quality and reliability of the application.

*   **Backend (Laravel):**
    *   **Unit Tests (Pest):** Test individual units of code (e.g., models, controllers, services) in isolation. Focus on testing the business logic and ensuring that each unit of code behaves as expected.
    *   **Feature Tests (Pest):** Test the application's features from an end-to-end perspective. Simulate user interactions and verify that the application behaves as expected.
    *   **Integration Tests (Pest):** Test the interaction between different components of the application (e.g., controllers and models).
*   **Frontend (React/TypeScript):**
    *   **Unit Tests (Vitest):** Test individual React components and utility functions in isolation. Use a mocking library (e.g., Jest Mock) to mock dependencies.
    *   **Component Tests (Vitest & React Testing Library (RTL)):** Test React components in a realistic environment. Use RTL to interact with the components as a user would.
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Cypress/Playwright):** Test the entire application from an end-to-end perspective. Simulate user interactions across multiple pages and verify that the application behaves as expected.
*   **Code Coverage:** Code coverage tools are used to measure the percentage of code that is covered by tests. Aim for high code coverage to ensure that most of the code is tested.
*   **Continuous Integration:** Tests are automatically run as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that code changes do not introduce regressions. Failed tests should block the deployment process.

### 9. Security & Hardening Plan

A 'security-first' approach is implemented to mitigate OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and other security risks.

*   **Input Validation:** All user inputs are validated on both the client-side and the server-side to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)). Laravel's built-in validation features are used for server-side validation.
*   **Output Encoding:** Output is encoded to prevent XSS attacks. Laravel's templating engine automatically escapes output by default.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Strong authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to protect sensitive data and functionality. Laravel Sanctum is used for API authentication, and policies and gates are used for authorization.
*   **Password Hashing:** User passwords are hashed using bcrypt to protect them from being compromised in the event of a data breach. Laravel's built-in hashing functions are used.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:** CSRF protection is enabled to prevent malicious websites from making unauthorized requests on behalf of authenticated users. Laravel's CSRF protection middleware is used.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Laravel's built-in rate limiting middleware is used.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Regular security audits are conducted to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities. Penetration testing is also performed to simulate real-world attacks.
*   **Dependency Management:** Dependencies are regularly updated to address known security vulnerabilities. A dependency management tool (e.g., Composer, npm) is used to manage dependencies and ensure that they are up-to-date.
*   **Security Headers:** Security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security) are configured to protect against various attacks.
*   **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database passwords) is encrypted at rest and in transit. Laravel's encryption features and HTTPS are used.
*   **OWASP ZAP:** Integration of OWASP ZAP into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for vulnerabilities with each build. This helps to catch security issues early in the development lifecycle. See [https://www.zaproxy.org/](https://www.zaproxy.org/) for more details.

### 10. Logging & Observability

A comprehensive logging and observability strategy is implemented to monitor the health and performance of the application.

*   **Logging:**
    *   **Application Logs:** Application logs are generated using Laravel's logging facade. Logs are written to the `stderr` channel for centralized logging in containerized environments. The `stderr` channel outputs log messages to the standard error stream, which is typically collected by container orchestration platforms.
    *   **Access Logs:** Access logs are generated by the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to track incoming requests.
    *   **Database Logs:** Database logs are enabled to track database queries and performance.
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** An APM tool (e.g., New Relic, Datadog, Sentry) is used to monitor the performance of the application and identify bottlenecks. APM tools provide insights into request latency, error rates, and other key metrics.
    *   **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Infrastructure monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) are used to monitor the health and performance of the infrastructure (e.g., servers, databases, Redis).
    *   **Error Tracking:** An error tracking tool (e.g., Sentry, Bugsnag) is used to track and report errors that occur in the application. This allows developers to quickly identify and fix errors.
*   **Alerting:** Alerts are configured to notify developers when critical events occur (e.g., high error rates, slow response times). Alerts can be sent via email, Slack, or other channels.
*   **Centralized Logging:** A centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk) is used to collect and analyze logs from all components of the application. This allows developers to easily search for and analyze logs across multiple systems.

Key metrics to monitor include:

*   **Request latency:** The time it takes to process a request.
*   **Error rates:** The percentage of requests that result in an error.
*   **CPU utilization:** The percentage of CPU resources that are being used.
*   **Memory utilization:** The percentage of memory resources that are being used.
*   **Database query performance:** The time it takes to execute database queries.
*   **Redis cache hit rate:** The percentage of requests that are served from the Redis cache.

Logging levels should be used appropriately (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`) to provide sufficient context for debugging and troubleshooting.
